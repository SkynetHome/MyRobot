# MyRobot
Arduino Leonardo powered Tank Robot

This is a work in process if someone happens to be reading this code rest assured that I am aware it is likely far from ideal. 
If anyone would like to suggest updates or revision I am all ears. This is my first major Arduino project and I have a lot left to learn.

Parts used for this build are:  
  DF Robot Dominator Chassis (metal gear motors version)  
  Arduino Leonardo (Genuine)
  Adafruit Motor Shield V2.3 (Genuine)  
  3 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors  
  2 DC Motors included with Dominator Chassis  
  Adafruit Pan and Tilt Kit  
  Eachine ET200 FPV Transmitter  
  Eachine LCD5802S Monitor  
  KEDSUM Upgraded Arduino Wireless Bluetooth Transceiver Module Slave   
  2 Red and 2 Blue LED's  
  Makeblock Gripper Kit  
  Tenergy 2200mAh Lipo Battery and Charger  
  .96 OLED Display  
  
  The current sketche allows for autopilot control of the robot using the three Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance or maned control via an Android Bluetooth app. While under manual control the robot moves forward, reverse, 0 degree turns in either direction. Controlled turning is achieved by tapping Lef or Right and then Forward on the controller. Pan and Tilt is currently only wired for tilt so that the camera mounted on the tilt can look up and down. App also controls turning on or off the 4 LED lights 2 Blue in front and 2 Red in rear.
