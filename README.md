# MyRobot
Arduino Leonardo powered Tank Robot

This is a work in process if someone happens to be reading this code rest assured that I am aware it is likely far from ideal. If anyone would like to suggest updates or revision I am all ears. This is my first major Arduino project and I have a lot left to learn.

Parts used for this build are:
  DF Robot Dominator Chassis (metal gear motors version)
  Arduino Leonardo (Genuine)
  Adafruit Motor Shield V2.3 (Genuine)
  3 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
  2 DC Motors included with Dominator Chassis
  Adafruit Pan and Tilt Kit
  Eachine ET200 FPV Transmitter
  Eachine LCD5802S Monitor
  KEDSUM Upgraded Arduino Wireless Bluetooth Transceiver Module Slave
